# react-weather
A simple react weather forecast app

This was built using React, using a starter kit called [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)

To view the app, checkout this repo then open [dist/index.html](../master/dist/index.html) in your browser. 

Alternatively, npm install && npm start -s to start dev mode.

This is app is very incomplete and does not have good test coverage. Given more time I would have liked to have broken down the components more and cleaned up the CSS, removing unecessary imports.

This app uses:
React
Webpack
Mocha + utils
bootstrap.css
openweathermap.org API
